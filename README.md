Still since quite long time going to the polling booth and standing in long queue to cast vote has been
persistent and it was challenging for the Government to motivate the public to participate in the
election system and cast their vote, as there was no such online voting system available.

soon for everyone to cast their vote to the candidate of their own choice with the un-matchable ease.
